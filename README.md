# Asynchronous-FIFO-with-8x8-bit-Register-Depth
Utilizing an 8-register deep FIFO structure, with each register storing 8 bits of data, this design operates asynchronously, simplifying data transfer between different clock domains. Developed using Icarus Verilog, the simulation results are presented in GTKwave, showcasing its efficiency and adaptability for managing data flow in digital systems.
