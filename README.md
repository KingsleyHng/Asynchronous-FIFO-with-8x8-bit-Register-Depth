Asynchronous FIFO with 8x8-bit Register Depth
This design features an asynchronous FIFO with a depth of eight registers, each capable of storing 8 bits of data. It is tailored to facilitate seamless data transfer across distinct clock domains, enhancing the robustness and flexibility of digital systems. The test bench for this FIFO is crafted in SystemVerilog and run in EDA Playground using Synopsys VCS for simulation.
